## handling mouse inputs and shooting projectiles

What do I need to do?
- Record mouse movement
	- track position
	- track on press/on click
- Shoot projectile
	- draw projectile
	- account for angle projectile is being shot at
	- account for velocity projectile is being shot at
	- create a stack to account for amout of projectiles on screen
	- check distance/time for how long each projectile flies
	- after x amount of time, pop projectile from stack.
